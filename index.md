### Angel Reese v. Caitlin Clark: Few-shot learning Sentiment Analysis with GPT-3.5

Sentiment analysis is target-oriented, aiming to identify opinions or attitudes towards topics or entities. In this project, I built a text classifier using OpenAI's Chat API, combined with a semantic similarity pipeline using SBERT for generating optimized prompt examples.

### Creating a Cross-Cultural music reccomendation system with Machine Learning

Developed a cross-cultural music recommendation system using Spotify API, audio feature extraction, unsupervised learning, clustering algorithms, matrix factorization, content-based and collaborative filtering to generate personalized playlists tailored to taste profiles.

For this, I used various ML techniques including: (i) Kmeans++, KNN (ii) Content-Based Filtering (iii) Collaborative Filtering (KnnBasic) (iv) Matrix Factorization (Singular Value Decomposition, Alternating Least Squares, and Non-negative Matrix Factorization)
